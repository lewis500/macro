TO DO
+ start in equilibrium
+ plot nominal interest rate
+ show values next to sliders
+ adapt axes
+ add a brush
+ plot the equilibrium real interest rate and ybar
+ have bounds appear on the sliders once you mouse over, use transitions.
+ format ticks

LATER
+ update package.json


=====DYNAMIC=====
+ set up play/pause button
+ set up d3 timer
+ labels on line ends
+ do faded dots and line segments like you did for the gridlocks vs bottlenecks one
+ get rid of the equations column
+ put all the parameter sliders below, only leave the interest rate slider to the right
+
