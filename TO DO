TO DO
+ plot nominal interest rate
+ show values next to sliders
+ have bounds appear on the sliders once you mouse over, use transitions.
+ format ticks


=====DYNAMIC=====
+ labels on line ends
+ do faded dots and line segments like you did for the gridlocks vs bottlenecks one
+ get rid of the equations column
+ put all the parameter sliders below, only leave the interest rate slider to the right
+ 




+ make one chart for y, another for i, r, \pi and \pi_e
+ put an arrow on the ends of the lines
